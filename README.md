# 3D-Prior GAN-Based Face Unmasking Network

## Description

This repository implements a **non-deterministic face mask removal framework** based on 3D priors, inspired by the paper "NON-DETERMINISTIC FACE MASK REMOVAL BASED ON 3D PRIORS" by Yin et al. The approach integrates a multi-task 3D face reconstruction module with a face inpainting module to generate controllable and diverse unmasking results.

Unlike traditional deterministic methods, this framework allows **dynamic face editing** by controlling 3D shape parameters, enabling generation of faces with different expressions and mouth movements.

## Key Features

* **Non-deterministic Results:** Generate diverse face completions instead of single fixed outputs
* **3D-Guided Inpainting:** Leverages 3DMM parameters for geometrically consistent face reconstruction
* **Controllable Generation:** Modify expressions and facial features through 3D parameter manipulation
* **Robust Mask Detection:** Trained on synthetic masked faces for improved generalization

## Training Strategy

### Two-Phase Training Process:

#### Phase 1: N3D Module (5,000 steps)
Train 3D reconstruction and mask segmentation jointly:
```
L₃D = L_bce + L_coef + L_photo + λ_id·L_id + λ_lm·L_lm
```

#### Phase 2: Inpainting Module (2,000 steps)
Train generator with frozen N3D module:
```
L_G = λ_pix·L_pix + λ_id·L_id + λ_tv·L_tv + λ_adv·L_adv
```

### Hyperparameters:
* **Batch Size:** 8
* **Learning Rate:** 1e-4 → 1e-5 (at midpoint)
